Hi, I am a software engineer, curious about all computer science, especially backend, services,<br/>
and system programming.<br/>

More than 10 years of commercial experience, last time working mostly as full stack, use Python,<br/>
love Django, know JS, have a background with system programming, reverse engineering.<br/>

Regularly participate in leetcode contests, have a few public Python packages on PyPI.<br/>
